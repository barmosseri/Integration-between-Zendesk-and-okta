This script used to automate the process of creating users in Okta based on tickets in Zendesk. It allows only certain approved users to approve the creation of a user, and uses custom fields on the ticket to determine the details for the user to be created in Okta. It also updates the ticket with comments indicating the status of the user creation process and, if successful, marks the ticket as solved.

More informative:
The automation imports several libraries and retrieves secrets for Zendesk and Okta from AWS Secrets Manager. It then sets environment variables for these secrets and uses them to create clients for Zendesk and Okta.
Next, the script searches for tickets in Zendesk with the subject "create a new user" and iterates through them. If a ticket's status is not "pending", "on-hold", or "solved", it retrieves the values of several other custom fields (first name, last name, email, and organization) and checks whether they are all non-empty. If any of these fields is empty, the script creates a public comment on the ticket indicating that there are missing details and changes the ticket's status to "pending".
If all of the required fields are present, the script attempts to retrieve the user from Okta using the email provided in the ticket. If the user already exists, it will send a reset password email to the user and updates the ticket's status to "solved". If the user does not exist, it will checks whether the request has been approved by a user in the APPROVED_USER_GROUP_ID list by checking for a private comment on the ticket with the body "Approved" from an approved user. If the request has been approved, the script creates the user in Okta and updates the ticket's status to "solved". If the request has not been approved, the script creates a public comment on the ticket indicating that the request wasn't approved and updates the ticket's status to "on-hold".
